# bootloader example
example code for a very minimalistic x64 BIOS bootloader providing a memory map, page table, long mode and an example c program which gets executed by it.

compile.sh to compile (requires nasm, gcc and ld) <br>
run.sh to run in qemu (will not work on any system since the qemu executable names differ)

I still need to document this way better when i have time.
If you need help, feel free to contact me tho.
